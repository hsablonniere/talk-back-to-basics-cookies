* the fact that the registration is magical bugs me
* I would prefer roles to be an array
* The context should be simple Object literal JSONifyiable
* I like the "next" behaviour but
** I'm not sure about template options being a array of template indexed by context in an object literal
* could we pass the context and not index them
* can I really fallback on classic template?

The CSS selector matcher syntax

* feels good to use ;-)
** it allowed me to split some code into several functions
** it could help to use the same templating on 2 different selectors
* needs to be moved in core
** or core needs to just give me a callback for all converts/transforms
* some stuffs could be improved
** :not(selector) could help to narrow some stuffs
** E[foo^="bar"] and E[foo$="bar"] could help too
** should we start supporting + ~ > or "space"?
*** For example, I would like to transform only image that are children of document or section
